1-access to the hacker news
2-use the developer tools of chrome to see the code of the page
3-observe the page html and descrive the structure:
	first i see that it's a html code, which had a head and a body, the head had a few commands i guess and the body contains the majority code of the page, it's compose by a table that had a tbody that had all the list of 30 links and all the other details that come with them.
4-tab 'Sources', theres a list of files under an icon called 'Top', about the files hn.js and news.css:
	the hn.js seems to be the one that had all the functions of the page, so it could work properly.
	and the news.css contains a lot of differents commands i guess, but looking closely i recognize some type of fonts commands, so i guess it's about the page that make the page look how it looks and that everything it's place correctly.
5-tab 'Network', refresh the page and check the requests methods. theres 7 files that when i refresh the page, take different time to load.. 
	How many requests has it taken for the browser to download the Hacker News main page? its very fast but apparently 5 from 7.
	What are the HTTP request methods in each case? In everycase it's a 'GET' method.
	Check out the HTTP response headers and find out what kind of web server is used for this website. From the 'Headers' i can see that its 'nginx'.
